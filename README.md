# String-Designer

String Designer is a polyphonic implementation of the Karplus-Strong algorithm able to create plucked strings sounds through Physical Modelling synthesis techniques. By tweaking parameters of the plugin it is possible to achieve sounds from instruments such as keyboard, piano, guitar, bass, and more.
