Information on testing the plugin.
\
The plugin has been tested to work on standalone mode, there are still some issues with polyphony but haven't had the chance to debug yet.
\
In case during testing a build error is found, add the file Background_synth_png (found in Resources Folder) and add it to the Projucer file explorer with the exact same name.
\
If more issues were to be found, please make sure that binary resource is ticked by right clicking on the file in Projucer file explorer .
\
Thank you!}
